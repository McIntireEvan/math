      <description>Hi! This blog is mostly about Math, though I might touch on other subjects from time to time. My goal is to explore interesting subjects in &amp;ldquo;higher math&amp;rdquo;, and present them in a more approachable way. In the words of one of my favorite professors, I want to &amp;ldquo;tell stories&amp;rdquo; about math. Having been through an undergrad in Math, I do think that proofs and exercises are essential to mastery of concepts.</description>

      <description>In my senior year of college, I took a course on Euclidean and non-Euclidean Geometry.1 Euclidean Geometry was codified by the Greek mathematician Euclid, in his book Elements. It&amp;rsquo;s likely what you think of when you think about Geometry. In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll look at what happens if we replace a key part of this geometry we&amp;rsquo;re used to. I&amp;rsquo;ll also touch on a generalization that this exploration leads to, and some fun examples.</description>
