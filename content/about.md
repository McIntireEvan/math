Hi! In the words of one of my favorite professors, I want to “tell stories” about math. It goes without saying that rigorous proofs are vital for a mathematician’s development. That said, I believe that having intuitive “stories” about these proofs and ideas can make things go a lot easier.

I want to help create intuition about these subjects, and create explanations that my non-mathematician friends can understand and appreciate.

If anything I write is incorrect or misleading, let me know! Make an issue on Github or elsewhere.

I plan on writing ~1 post per month.
